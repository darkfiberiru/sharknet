# sharknet
Sharknet is a tool designed to allow simple autoconfigured direct connectivity from a NAS to a client system. Commonly these direct connections will be highspeed expensive ports. This removes need for switches and simplifies network setup. This setup is only recommended for certain niche use cases of FreeNAS. This is especially important in certain Media and Entertainment workflows where small shops with little to no IT resources may need exceptional storage performance with minmial componets and configuration.

While sharknet is external to FreeNAS it is designed to integrate seamlessly after setup. Registering itself appropriatly across FreeNAS so FreeNAS understands the parts it needs to and ignores the ones it doesn't.
